## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create an intelligent agent using the capabilities of Together AI and LangChain. These technologies enable the agent to understand and process natural language, making it suitable for a variety of applications.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing:** The agent can understand and process natural language inputs.
- **Modular Design:** The codebase is modular, making it easy to extend and customize.
- **High Performance:** Built with performance in mind, the agent can handle complex tasks efficiently.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Pahyn/Agent-using-Together-AI-and-LangChain.git
    ```
2. Change to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Agent-using-Together-AI-and-LangChain
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Together AI
Together AI provide free LLM API which can be used for small scale project. However, not all model are free to use.

## Usage

To use the agent, follow these steps:

1. Configure the agent by editing the configuration file (`config.yaml`).
2. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Configuration

The configuration file (`config.yaml`) allows you to customize various aspects of the agent, such as API keys, model parameters, and other settings.
